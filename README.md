# Water Potability Prediction using Data Analytics

Predicting the potability of water based on various physicochemical features using machine learning models.

## Introduction

Safe drinking water is crucial for health and well-being. This project aims to classify water samples as potable (safe for drinking) or not, based on various features of the water. Through comprehensive data analysis and machine learning, we endeavor to provide a robust model that can assist in ensuring water quality.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains several attributes that play a critical role in determining water quality, including pH, hardness, solids, and more. Each attribute contributes to the overall potability of the water.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Before building the models, an in-depth exploratory data analysis was performed. This helped in understanding the distribution, relationships, and characteristics of different features related to water quality.

## Data Preprocessing

- Identification and handling of null values.
- Treatment of outliers.
- Feature scaling and normalization.

## Model Training and Evaluation

Three models were trained and evaluated:
1. **K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN):** Achieved an accuracy of 64%.
2. **Decision Tree:** Obtained an accuracy of 61%.
3. **Random Forest:** Emerged as the most effective model with an accuracy of 69%.

## Conclusion and Future Work

The Random Forest classifier was identified as the best model for predicting water potability. While the project achieved significant milestones, there's potential for further enhancement by incorporating more diverse data and possibly including other influential parameters like dissolved oxygen, location, and the impact of climate change on water quality.
